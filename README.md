https://codesbya.github.io/theFoodFactory/
- This is a demo website for food chains.
- Built on html (Semantic tags), css, Javascript (Es6).
- The website features animations, a loader, and it is fully responsive.
- Created the custom loader and button animations using CSS.
- Footer has links with their own animations.
- Fully responsive
- Button animations were created using CSS.
- The nav bar connects to the page after scrolling and a button to scroll back up appears for easy navigation. 

# What can be improved
- Images used are from high resolution images from unsplash. This sometimes results in the website having longer load times.
